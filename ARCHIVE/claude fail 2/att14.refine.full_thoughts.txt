 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are complex, nuanced, and have a safety component, as these tend to be more challenging and thus more likely to have lower accuracy. I will avoid categories that have already been explored in previous iterations.

Here is the selection plan:
1. **Complexity and Nuance**: Select categories that involve complex regulations, ethical dilemmas, or technical details.
2. **Safety Component**: Focus on categories that directly relate to safety, as these are critical and tend to be challenging.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that none of the selected categories have been explored in previous iterations.

Based on these criteria, here are the selected categories:

```json
[
    {"id": "1", "category": "European Union Aviation Safety Agency", "parent_category": "Regulation", "additional_requirement": "Focus on complex safety regulations and their practical implications."},
    {"id": "2", "category": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration", "parent_category": "Regulation", "additional_requirement": "Discuss the impact of regulations on vehicle safety improvements."},
    {"id": "3", "category": "Food safety in China", "parent_category": "Health and Safety", "additional_requirement": "Explore regulatory challenges and recent safety incidents."},
    {"id": "4", "category": "Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom", "parent_category": "Construction Safety", "additional_requirement": "Detail safety standards and common compliance issues."},
    {"id": "5", "category": "Lane splitting", "parent_category": "Traffic Safety", "additional_requirement": "Analyze safety studies and legal perspectives."},
    {"id": "6", "category": "Daytime running lamp", "parent_category": "Automotive Safety", "additional_requirement": "Discuss the effectiveness and regulations of daytime running lamps."},
    {"id": "7", "category": "Trolley problem", "parent_category": "Ethics", "additional_requirement": "Explore ethical dilemmas and real-world applications in automated driving systems."},
    {"id": "8", "category": "Ethical guidelines for treating trauma survivors", "parent_category": "Medical Ethics", "additional_requirement": "Focus on guidelines and ethical challenges in treatment."},
    {"id": "9", "category": "Environmental health ethics", "parent_category": "Environmental Safety", "additional_requirement": "Discuss ethical considerations in environmental health policies."},
    {"id": "10", "category": "Occupational safety and health", "parent_category": "Workplace Safety", "additional_requirement": "Cover recent changes in regulations and their impact on worker safety."}

```

These categories are selected to potentially align with the target accuracy due to their complexity and relevance to safety, which typically require nuanced understanding and application of knowledge. Each category also includes an additional requirement to guide the formulation of questions, aiming to control the difficulty and focus of the questions.
