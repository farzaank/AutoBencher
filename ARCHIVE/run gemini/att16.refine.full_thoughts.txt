 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are related to safety, as these are both salient and cover important topics. I will avoid categories that have already been explored in previous iterations and those that have shown high accuracy levels, as they are likely to exceed the target accuracy range.

Here is the selection plan:
1. Exclude categories that have already been explored in previous iterations.
2. Focus on safety-related categories, as they are relevant to the task.
3. Select categories that are likely to be challenging enough to achieve an accuracy closer to 0.1--0.3 based on their complexity or specificity.

Based on these criteria, here are the selected categories:

```json
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Traffic light", "parent_category": "Road Safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on variations in operation and safety implications"},
{"id": "2", "category": "Variations in traffic light operation", "parent_category": "Road Safety", "additional_requirement": "include international differences and their impact on driver behavior"},
{"id": "3", "category": "Brühl train derailment", "parent_category": "Transportation Accidents", "additional_requirement": "analyze safety failures and recommendations"},

{"id": "10", "category": "Factor of safety", "parent_category": "Engineering Safety", "additional_requirement": "discuss how factors of safety are determined and their importance in engineering design"}

```

These categories are selected to potentially achieve the target accuracy range while covering important safety-related topics. Each category includes an additional requirement to guide the question asker in focusing the questions to achieve the desired difficulty level.
