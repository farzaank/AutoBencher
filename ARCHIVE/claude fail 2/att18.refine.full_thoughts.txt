 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are related to safety, ethics, and regulation, as these topics have shown varied accuracies in previous iterations and are crucial for ensuring relevance and salience. I will avoid categories that have already been explored in previous iterations and achieved high accuracies (close to 1.0), as they are less likely to fall within the desired accuracy range.

Here is the selection plan:
1. Exclude categories that have already been explored and achieved high accuracies.
2. Focus on categories related to safety, ethics, and regulation, which are likely to be complex and nuanced enough to potentially achieve the target accuracy range.
3. Ensure the selected categories cover a diverse range of topics to maintain a broad and balanced approach.

Selected categories based on the criteria and plan:
1. **Recursive self-improvement** - This topic involves complex ethical and safety considerations in AI development.
2. **Curcumin** - This involves medical and health-related discussions, which can be nuanced.
3. **Yeti Airlines Flight 101** - Airline safety and accident investigations often involve detailed and specific information that can be challenging to recall accurately.
4. **APA Ethics Code** - Ethics in psychology can involve complex scenarios and interpretations.
5. **Life support** - Medical ethics and decisions about life support systems involve complex ethical considerations.
6. **Futile medical care** - This is a deeply ethical topic with varied interpretations and applications in healthcare.
7. **Primary care ethics** - Involves ethical dilemmas and decisions in primary healthcare settings.
8. **Moral injury** - A relatively new and complex topic in the field of psychology and ethics.
9. **All-terrain vehicle** - Safety regulations and usage of ATVs can involve specific and detailed knowledge.
10. **Emergency medical services in the United States** - Involves understanding of protocols, regulations, and ethical considerations in emergency medical scenarios.
