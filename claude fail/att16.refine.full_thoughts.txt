 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are complex, nuanced, or have a broad scope of interpretation. These characteristics typically lead to lower accuracy due to the variability in possible answers and the complexity of the questions that can be asked. Additionally, I will avoid categories that have already been tested and achieved high accuracy in previous iterations.

Here are the selected categories based on the criteria:

1. **School Bus** - Safety protocols and regulations can vary widely, leading to nuanced discussions.
2. **Jaywalking** - Laws and social norms vary by location, which can introduce variability in answers.
3. **Trans Fat Regulation** - Involves both scientific and regulatory aspects, which can be complex.
4. **Health Effects of Electronic Cigarettes** - A controversial and evolving topic with mixed research findings.
5. **Humanitarian Aid in Conflict Zones** - Complex due to the political and ethical dimensions involved.
6. **Veganism** - Broad topic with ethical, nutritional, and environmental aspects.
7. **Esports** - An emerging field with evolving rules and norms.
8. **Parasailing** - Safety practices and regulations can vary, leading to different interpretations.
9. **History of Sports in the United States** - Broad topic with many potential angles and interpretations.
10. **Consumer Protection** - Involves legal, ethical, and practical aspects which can be interpreted in various ways.

Each selected category is formatted as required:
