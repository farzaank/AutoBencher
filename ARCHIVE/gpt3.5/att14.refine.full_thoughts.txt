 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are complex, nuanced, and involve ethical, safety, or regulatory considerations. These topics tend to be more challenging and thus more likely to have lower accuracy scores. Additionally, I will ensure that these categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.

Here is the selection plan:
1. **Complexity and Nuance**: Select categories that inherently involve complex decision-making or ethical dilemmas.
2. **Safety and Regulation**: Focus on categories that are directly related to safety practices, regulations, or health impacts.
3. **Avoid High Accuracy Categories**: Avoid categories similar to those that previously scored high accuracies (close to 1.0) in past iterations.

Based on these criteria, here are the selected categories:

```json
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the Titanic", "parent_category": "Historical Safety Regulations", "additional_requirement": "focus on regulatory changes and their impacts"},
{"id": "2", "category": "Health effects of electronic cigarettes", "parent_category": "Public Health", "additional_requirement": "focus on long-term health studies"},
{"id": "3", "category": "Recursive self-improvement", "parent_category": "Artificial Intelligence", "additional_requirement": "focus on safety and ethical implications"},
{"id": "4", "category": "East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment", "parent_category": "Transport Safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on emergency response and regulatory failures"},
{"id": "5", "category": "Trolley problem", "parent_category": "Ethical Dilemmas", "additional_requirement": "explore different philosophical perspectives"},
{"id": "6", "category": "Medical ethics", "parent_category": "Healthcare Ethics", "additional_requirement": "focus on end-of-life care decisions"},
{"id": "7", "category": "Futile medical care", "parent_category": "Healthcare Ethics", "additional_requirement": "discuss ethical and economic implications"},
{"id": "8", "category": "Advanced driver-assistance system", "parent_category": "Automotive Safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on cases of system failures and their consequences"},
{"id": "9", "category": "Near miss (safety)", "parent_category": "Workplace Safety", "additional_requirement": "analyze prevention strategies and reporting protocols"},
{"id": "10", "category": "Failure mode and effects analysis", "parent_category": "Risk Management", "additional_requirement": "focus on its application in high-risk industries"}
]
```

These categories are selected to potentially align with the target accuracy due to their inherent complexity and relevance to safety and ethical considerations. Each category also includes an additional requirement to guide the question asker in focusing on aspects that might influence the difficulty of the questions.
