 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
Please start with iteration 1.Here are the category candidates to select from (delimited by ||): Medication || Pharmacy || West Pharmaceutical Services || Pharmaceutical marketing || Otsuka Pharmaceutical || Glycerol || Torrent Pharmaceuticals || List of pharmaceutical companies || Bausch Health || Pharmaceutical industry || Impersonator || Elvis impersonator || Male impersonation || Drag queen || Police impersonation || Impersonating a public servant || Female impersonation || Strange Impersonation || The Great Impersonation || Electoral fraud in the United States || Safety || Psychological safety || Occupational safety and health || Maslow's hierarchy of needs || Food safety || Physical hazard || Health || Physical layer || Amber alert || Gymnastics elements named after Simone Biles || Threat (computer security) || Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act || NIST Cybersecurity Framework || National Cybersecurity Authority (Saudi Arabia) || Computer security || Cyber threat intelligence || National Cybersecurity FFRDC || List of cyber warfare forces || Israeli cybersecurity industry || LevelBlue || Pig butchering scam || Advance-fee scam || Romance scam || 1992 Indian stock market scam || Scam || List of scams || Sakvithi Ranasinghe || Bad Boy Billionaires: India || Scam baiting || Explained (TV series) || Natural disaster || List of natural disasters by death toll || The Natural Disasters || List of natural disasters in Pakistan || Natural disasters in Japan || Natural disasters in China || List of natural disasters in Indonesia || List of natural disasters in the United States || Disaster || Lists of disasters || Toxicity || California Department of Toxic Substances Control || Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 || List of highly toxic gases || Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances || Toxic waste || Substances poisonous to dogs || Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances || Dangerous goods || 2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump || Information privacy || Data Privacy Day || Data Privacy Lab || Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal || General Data Protection Regulation || Data mining || Privacy policy || Differential privacy || EU–US Data Privacy Framework || Privacy law || Kids Online Safety Act || Children's Online Privacy Protection Act || Internet safety || Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command || Online child abuse || Sexual grooming || Child protection || Child || Online Safety Act 2023 || Online Safety Act (Sri Lanka) || List of scams || Scam || Advance-fee scam || Blessing scam || Romance scam || Scams (TV series) || Jim Browning (YouTuber) || Maria Duval scam || True Link || Old age
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, we need to select categories that are complex enough to challenge the accuracy of knowledge-intensive questions but also have a significant impact on safety, as per the criteria provided. Given the list of candidate categories, I will focus on those that are likely to produce questions of varying difficulty levels and are relevant to safety, both directly and indirectly. 

The plan involves selecting categories that:
1. Are related to safety and security, as these topics inherently come with nuanced details that can affect the accuracy of knowledge-intensive questions.
2. Have a broad impact on public health or welfare, thus ensuring the salience of the topics.
3. Can be adjusted in difficulty through additional requirements, allowing for fine-tuning towards the target accuracy.

Based on these criteria, here are the selected categories with their additional requirements aimed at modulating question difficulty:

```json
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Pharmaceutical industry", "parent_category": "Healthcare", "additional_requirement": "focus on regulatory and safety aspects"},
{"id": "2", "category": "Cyber threat intelligence", "parent_category": "Cybersecurity", "additional_requirement": "emphasize recent significant threats and their mitigation"},
{"id": "3", "category": "Natural disasters in Japan", "parent_category": "Natural disasters", "additional_requirement": "only ask about events post-2000 to ensure relevance and specificity"},
{"id": "4", "category": "Data Privacy Day", "parent_category": "Information privacy", "additional_requirement": "include questions on historical significance and impact on legislation"},
{"id": "5", "category": "Occupational safety and health", "parent_category": "Workplace safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on industries with high risk of accidents"},
{"id": "6", "category": "Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976", "parent_category": "Environmental law", "additional_requirement": "questions should explore its impact on environmental safety and health regulations"},
{"id": "7", "category": "Online child abuse", "parent_category": "Internet safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on prevention and awareness campaigns"},
{"id": "8", "category": "Police impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion and detail notable cases"},
{"id": "9", "category": "List of natural disasters in the United States", "parent_category": "Natural disasters", "additional_requirement": "focus on the last two decades to maintain relevance"},
{"id": "10", "category": "General Data Protection Regulation", "parent_category": "Data protection", "additional_requirement": "explore its global impact beyond the EU"}
]
```

These categories and their additional requirements are designed to ensure that the questions asked can be adjusted in difficulty to aim for the target accuracy range, while also covering important topics related to safety and security. The focus on recent events, regulatory impacts, and prevention strategies should help in achieving the desired accuracy by making the questions more specific and challenging.
