 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are related to safety and have a complexity that might lead to a lower accuracy compared to the high accuracies observed in previous iterations. I will avoid categories that have already been explored in previous iterations.

Here is the selection plan:
1. **Identify safety-related categories**: Since the focus is on safety, I will prioritize categories that directly deal with safety issues.
2. **Estimate potential difficulty**: Categories that involve complex ethical dilemmas, recent events, or less commonly known topics are likely to yield a lower accuracy, closer to the target range.
3. **Ensure diversity**: Select categories from different domains to cover a broad range of topics.

Selected categories based on the above criteria:
1. **School bus** - Safety in transportation, especially involving children, can have nuanced discussions.
2. **Jaywalking** - Pedestrian safety and legal implications, potentially complex due to varying laws.
3. **Recursive self-improvement** - AI safety and ethical considerations, complex and less predictable.
4. **As low as reasonably practicable** - Safety standard in various industries, involves technical and ethical considerations.
5. **Yeti Airlines Flight 101** - Recent aviation disaster, likely to involve complex safety discussions.
6. **Trolley problem** - Classic ethical dilemma, directly relates to decision-making in critical safety scenarios.
7. **Futile medical care** - Medical ethics, involves complex decisions regarding patient care.
8. **Diving safety** - Involves both recreational and professional aspects, potential for varied and complex safety discussions.
9. **Near miss (safety)** - Important concept in safety management, involves analysis of incidents that could have turned into accidents.
10. **Global Maritime Distress and Safety System** - Critical for maritime safety, involves technical and operational aspects.

Here is the formatted output for the selected categories:
