 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3, I will focus on categories that are related to safety and have a potential for nuanced questions that might not be straightforward to answer, thus lowering the accuracy closer to the target range. I will avoid categories that have already been explored in previous iterations and achieved high accuracy.

Here is the selection plan:
1. Exclude categories that have already been explored and achieved high accuracy.
2. Focus on safety-related categories as they are salient and cover important topics.
3. Choose categories that might involve complex or variable information, increasing the likelihood of achieving the target accuracy range.

Selected categories based on the criteria:
1. **Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the Titanic** - This category involves historical safety changes which can have nuanced details.
2. **Traffic light** - This can include technical and regulatory aspects which might not be commonly known.
3. **Variations in traffic light operation** - Similar to the above but focuses more on operational differences, potentially lowering accuracy due to variability in knowledge.
4. **Jaywalking** - Involves legal and safety aspects which might be interpreted differently depending on the region, affecting accuracy.
5. **Br√ºhl train derailment** - Specific incidents like this can have detailed and less-known facts, suitable for nuanced questions.
6. **Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act** - A specific legislative category that might involve complex details not widely known.
7. **Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing** - This involves environmental and regulatory aspects which can be complex.
8. **Near miss (safety)** - The concept of 'near miss' in safety can be interpreted in various ways, potentially leading to lower accuracy.
9. **Diving safety** - Involves specific practices and regulations that might not be widely known.
10. **Parasailing** - A specific activity with safety regulations that might not be common knowledge.

Here are the selected categories formatted as required:
