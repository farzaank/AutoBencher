 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.0-0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.0-0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.0-0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select categories that are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.0-0.3, we need to focus on topics that are complex, nuanced, and potentially controversial, where straightforward answers are less likely. Given the high accuracy rates in previous iterations, we should aim for categories that involve ethical dilemmas, legal ambiguities, or emerging technologies, as these areas tend to have more subjective interpretations and could lead to lower accuracy in question answering.

Here's the plan:
1. Identify categories related to ethics, legal issues, and emerging technologies.
2. Ensure these categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
3. Add additional requirements to increase the difficulty or focus of the questions, aiming to lower the accuracy closer to the target range.

Based on the provided list, here are the selected categories:

```json
[
  {"id": "1", "category": "Intersex medical interventions", "parent_category": "Medical ethics", "additional_requirement": "focus on ethical controversies and differing medical opinions"},
  {"id": "2", "category": "Allow natural death", "parent_category": "Medical ethics", "additional_requirement": "discuss ethical dilemmas and legal implications"},
  {"id": "3", "category": "Gun show loophole", "parent_category": "Legal technicality", "additional_requirement": "explore implications on safety and regulation"},
  {"id": "4", "category": "Prisonâ€“industrial complex", "parent_category": "Legal issues", "additional_requirement": "focus on ethical and safety concerns"},
  {"id": "5", "category": "Legal history of cannabis in the United States", "parent_category": "Legal issues", "additional_requirement": "discuss changes in perception and law"},
  {"id": "6", "category": "Sovereign citizen movement", "parent_category": "Legal issues", "additional_requirement": "explore legal and societal impacts"},
  {"id": "7", "category": "Online gambling", "parent_category": "Legal issues", "additional_requirement": "focus on regulatory challenges and ethical concerns"},
  {"id": "8", "category": "Ethics of artificial intelligence", "parent_category": "Ethics", "additional_requirement": "discuss moral dilemmas and societal impacts"},
  {"id": "9", "category": "Moral outsourcing", "parent_category": "Ethics", "additional_requirement": "explore implications of delegating ethical decisions"},
  {"id": "10", "category": "The Social Dilemma", "parent_category": "Ethics of technology", "additional_requirement": "analyze impacts on privacy and human behavior"}
]
```

These categories have been chosen to potentially lower the accuracy due to their complexity and the subjective nature of their content. The additional requirements are designed to further focus the questions on aspects that are likely to be challenging and provoke diverse opinions or interpretations.
