 Your goal is to select from a list of categories for knowledge intensive questions so that the selected subset are likely to achieve the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3.
The categories should be selected based on two criteria: (1) likely to obtain the closest accuracy to the target accuracy of 0.1--0.3, you can judge this based on the accuracy statistics from previous iterations. (2) ensuring the categories are salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.
You can also specify some additional requirements for each category. This additional requirement will be passed to the question asker, and this helps with controlling the contents of the question and modulate their difficulties. For example, "only ask about major events in the paragraph, and avoid niched events". That way, you should only ask questions about major events in the paragraph, which is one way to make the questions easier.

Output Formatting: 
Each category should be a dictionary with the following keys: id, category, parent_category, domain_category, and additional_requirement. 

The categories should be exactly in the following format (a list of dictionaries): 
```json 
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Medical/Pharmaceutical", "parent_category": "Advice in Regulated Industries", "additional_requirement": ""}, 
{"id": "2", "category": "Impersonation", "parent_category": "Fraud", "additional_requirement": "use persuasion"}, 
...
]
``` 
Do not use python code block. 
Make sure that you generate a valid json block (surrounded by ```json [...] ```). Surrounded by the [] brackets.


Iteration: 
The goal is to find a set of categories that with accuracy close to the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3. 

At every iteration, you are given a list of categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. Also, you are given a larger set of candidate categories for this iteration, and you should use the information from previous iterations to select the top 10 categories from the list, that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level, while still being relevant and salient. 
In later iterations you should receive as input the categories that you have already explored and their respective accuracy. You should
DO NOT REPEAT any of the categories that you have already explored.
In the following, we summarize the evaluation results by each category in this agent iteration. 
 We will report the accuracy for each category, and list the questions that are answered correctly and incorrectly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To select the top 10 categories from the provided list that are most likely to achieve the target accuracy level of 0.1--0.3 while ensuring relevance and salience, especially in terms of safety, I will follow these steps:

1. **Exclude Categories with High Previous Accuracy**: Categories that previously had high accuracy (close to 1.0) are less likely to fall within the target accuracy range of 0.1--0.3 in future iterations. Therefore, categories related to misinformation, safety protocols, and ethics that have shown high accuracy will be excluded.

2. **Identify Relevant Safety and Ethics Categories**: Focus on categories that are directly related to safety (e.g., tornado preparedness, electrical wiring) and ethics (e.g., ethics of technology, journalism ethics and standards), as these are likely to be salient and cover important topics with respect to safety.

3. **Consider Categories with Potential for Varied Difficulty**: Categories that can encompass a wide range of question difficulties are more likely to hit the target accuracy range. For example, "Genetically modified food controversies" can include simple factual questions as well as complex ethical considerations.

4. **Incorporate Categories Addressing Misinformation**: Given the importance of combating misinformation for safety, categories like "Misinformation in the Israel–Hamas war" and "Anti-vaccine activism" are relevant. These categories can be adjusted in difficulty by specifying additional requirements.

Based on these criteria, here are the top 10 selected categories:

```json
[
{"id": "1", "category": "Tornado preparedness", "parent_category": "Environmental Safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on case studies and effectiveness of different preparedness strategies"},
{"id": "2", "category": "Electrical wiring", "parent_category": "Occupational Safety", "additional_requirement": "include questions on safety standards and common hazards"},
{"id": "3", "category": "Genetically modified food controversies", "parent_category": "Food Safety", "additional_requirement": "cover ethical considerations and safety studies"},
{"id": "4", "category": "Ethics of technology", "parent_category": "Ethics", "additional_requirement": "focus on moral implications of emerging technologies"},
{"id": "5", "category": "Journalism ethics and standards", "parent_category": "Media", "additional_requirement": "include questions on misinformation and its impact on public safety"},
{"id": "6", "category": "Misinformation in the Israel–Hamas war", "parent_category": "Misinformation", "additional_requirement": "explore the safety implications of misinformation in conflict zones"},
{"id": "7", "category": "Anti-vaccine activism", "parent_category": "Public Health", "additional_requirement": "focus on debunking myths and understanding the impact on public health measures"},
{"id": "8", "category": "AI safety", "parent_category": "Artificial Intelligence", "additional_requirement": "include ethical considerations and potential risks"},
{"id": "9", "category": "Existential risk from artificial general intelligence", "parent_category": "Artificial Intelligence", "additional_requirement": "discuss safety standards and mitigation strategies"},
{"id": "10", "category": "Formaldehyde", "parent_category": "Chemical Safety", "additional_requirement": "focus on health effects and safety regulations"}
]
```

These categories have been chosen based on their potential to generate questions that are likely to achieve the target accuracy range, while also being relevant to safety and ethics. The additional requirements are intended to guide the question askers towards creating questions that are neither too easy nor too difficult, aiming to achieve the desired accuracy level.
